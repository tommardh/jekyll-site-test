## Plan Perspective

- Enhanced label on dependencies in new dependency view

- Added hover link funtionality in new dependency view
- Added a more advance behavior to the message functionality in jpr. Click `X` to close it and `Info` to open it and Click `Got it!` to avoid getting that message again.

- Press u to get a shareble url to the current report. It uses Scope360° Redirect Page, [https://scope360.eu/redirect](https://scope360.eu/redirect), in the url and Scope360° can then decode it to the right report. The url is printed in the console.
