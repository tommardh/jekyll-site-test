perspective: Plan
summary: The plan is visualized through a number of complementary views. A view shows which deliveries each team has planned, including dependencies to other teams. Another view shows the team's plans iteration for iteration and a third view gives a status overview measured in the number of issues in each JIRA epic that has status to do, in progress and done.
